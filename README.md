# Time Series Forecast Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution
This repository contains the R code and research paper that resulted from the research project I worked on under the supervision of Dr. Michael Tsiang in the UCLA Statistics Department. The goal of the project was to use ARIMA models to forecast and predict 30 days of COVID-19 vaccine distribution for the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and China.

Research paper has been published in Volume 15 of SIAM Undergraduate Research Online (SIURO).
